<h2>Description</h2>
This game was created for the Acerola GameJam. The theme of the jam was Aberration, which inspired me to explore the topic of monsters. To avoid a serious tone, I decided to add a touch of humor. The final game revolves around making monsters from the attic laugh using jokes. While the core mechanic is based on the classic rock-paper-scissors system, the game isn't that simple without reading the instructions. Instead of choosing a single move, the player is given random tokens to place in attack slots, targeting the opponent's defense fields. Depending on the type of fear the opponent has, the outcome of the clash is determined. There are five opponents, each with their own strategy. Additionally, special point sequences unlock unique effects during the game.

A more detailed description of the game mechanics is available on the [Itch.io site](https://fushiboy.itch.io/comedy-attic) page.

<h2> General thoughts: </h2>



 <h3> ${\textsf{\color{GREEN}What I'm proud of:}}$ </h3>

ðŸŸ¢ This is the first game I've fully completed within a time limit.   
ðŸŸ¢ It's my first attempt at creating a strategy game.  
ðŸŸ¢ The code is relatively clean, and I made sure to stick to object-oriented programming principles.  
ðŸŸ¢ The UI concept, though visually unattractive, had potential in terms of design and usability.  
ðŸŸ¢ The tokens float nicely when tossed onto the book, which is a fun little touch! ðŸŽ±âœ¨  

<h3> ${\textsf{\color{RED}What I'm not satisfied with:}}$ </h3>

ðŸ”´ A simple concept ended up being too complicated for a game jam.  
ðŸ”´ The lack of a tutorial leaves players feeling confused.  
ðŸ”´ The graphics were a massive amount of work and still not as polished as I wanted.  
ðŸ”´ The handler for dropping objects onto specific fields wasnâ€™t written correctly, so its buggy sometimes.  

<h3> ${\textsf{\color{BLUE}What I learned:}}$  </h3>

ðŸ”µ Strategy games arenâ€™t the best idea for a game jam unless the concept is very simple.  
ðŸ”µ There are countless ideas that can be created from just one theme.  
ðŸ”µ There's still a lot of work and improvement ahead of me.  
ðŸ”µ The importance of using interfaces in programming.
