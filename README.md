<h2>Description</h2>
This game was created for the Acerola GameJam. The theme of the jam was Aberration, which inspired me to explore the topic of monsters. To avoid a serious tone, I decided to add a touch of humor. The final game revolves around making monsters from the attic laugh using jokes. While the core mechanic is based on the classic rock-paper-scissors system, the game isn't that simple without reading the instructions. Instead of choosing a single move, the player is given random tokens to place in attack slots, targeting the opponent's defense fields. Depending on the type of fear the opponent has, the outcome of the clash is determined. There are five opponents, each with their own strategy. Additionally, special point sequences unlock unique effects during the game.
